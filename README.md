# Data Structure for Online Judge

> By Wenze Jin

This project is tend to prepare templates of common data structures for online judge tests.

All templates are archived in the `lib` folder.

Codes of previous labs and tests will be archived in the `archived` folder.

> BTW，C++的模块组织形式过于古老，template类的实现必须要一并放在.h文件中，简直是一坨
